# MauiBeatCounter

A simple beat counter written in .net MAUI

This is a simple application that lets you tap out the beat of a song and find the
tempo in Beats per minute and Measures per minute. There are a couple of very simple
settings to change how you count (by measure or beat) and to specify the meter.

## The project

This is part of a larger project to compare and contrast multi-platform toolsets.

I've heavily documented the code I wrote, the bulk of which is in [ViewModel/CounterViewModel.cs]([lib/main.dart](https://github.com/dwgray/MauiBeatCounter/blob/main/MauiBeatCounter/ViewModel/CounterViewModel.cs)) and [View/MainPage.xaml](https://github.com/dwgray/MauiBeatCounter/blob/main/MauiBeatCounter/View/MainPage.xaml). The rest of the code is either generated by the framework or small tweaks to glue code.

Screenshots of the application on several platforms are in the [screenshots](screenshots) folder

I am documenting this project in a series of [medium.com](https://medium.com) posts.  The first post in the series "[Which Multi-platform framework should I use to write my app?](https://medium.com/@dwgray/which-multi-platform-framework-should-i-use-to-write-my-app-f1afbf330493)" gives more context about the project and describes how the app should behave. And the post that covers the .NET MAUI implementation of the app is [Which Multi-platform framework should I use to write my app? Letâ€™s try .NET MAUI.](https://medium.com/@dwgray/which-multi-platform-framework-should-i-use-to-write-my-app-lets-try-net-maui-d5f22126f9a6)
